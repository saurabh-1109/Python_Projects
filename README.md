🎲 Guess the Number
Guess the Number is a classic interactive game where the computer selects a random secret number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player's goal is to guess this number in the fewest attempts possible. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low, guiding the player towards the correct answer. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the number.

Key Python Concepts Used:

random.randint() for generating the secret number.

input() for taking the player's guess.

while loop to allow multiple guesses.

if-elif-else statements for providing feedback and checking the win condition.

🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game played between two opponents (in this case, the player and the computer). Both participants simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by a set of rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The game typically runs for a set number of rounds or until a player decides to quit.

Key Python Concepts Used:

random.choice() or random.randint() for the computer's move.

input() for the player's choice.

if-elif-else statements to implement the game's rules and determine the winner of each round.

while loop for playing multiple rounds.
